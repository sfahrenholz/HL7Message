/**
 * Components: <namespace ID (IS)> ^ <universal ID (ST)> ^ <universal ID type
 * (ID)>
 * 
 * Example: "ACME Pathology^2184^AUSNATA"
 * 
 * The HD is designed to be more powerful and more general replacement for the
 * application identifier of HL7 versions 2.1 and 2.2. It adds two additional
 * components, the <universal ID> and the <universal ID type> to the former
 * application ID (which is renamed more generically to be the namespace ID) The
 * basic definition of the HD is that it identifies an (administrative or system
 * or application or other) entity that has responsibility for managing or
 * assigning a defined set of instance identifiers (such as placer or filler
 * number, patient identifiers, provider identifiers, etc.). This entity could
 * be a particular health care application such as a registration system that
 * assigns patient identifiers, a governmental entity such as a licensing
 * authority that assigns professional identifiers or drivers’ license numbers,
 * or a facility where such identifiers are assigned.
